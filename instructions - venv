How to use virtual environment (venv) ? 

To install venv - 
$ python3 -m venv envname
will create a directory named envname which will include all the virtual environment. 


To start the venv - 
cd to the directory of the project. (named storage) 
and then type the command - 
$ source env/bin/activate 


This will start the virtual environment - 
(env) idan@idan-X540LA:~/python/storage$

To check that the python refers to the version in the vitual environment - 
which python3 
will output a path for a binary at the venv - 
		(env) idan@idan-X540LA:~/python/storage$ which python
		/home/idan/python/storage/env/bin/python


To stop the venv - 
$ deactivate
		(env) idan@idan-X540LA:~/python/storage$ deactivate
		idan@idan-X540LA:~/python/storage$ 




How to manage packages? 
Inside the venv - use pip, in my case pip3 for python3 . 

pip install packagename #Will install package named packagename
pip list #Will show packages list.
